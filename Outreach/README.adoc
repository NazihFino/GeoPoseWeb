# About GeoPose Outreach

Outreach activities of the GeoPose SWG and its members are important to raising the awareness of GeoPose among members of https://github.com/opengeospatial/GeoPoseWeb/blob/main/Outreach/Communities.adoc[communities (including Standards Working Groups)] and developers in https://github.com/opengeospatial/GeoPoseWeb/blob/main/Outreach/Companies.adoc[companies] who have requirements that can be met by GeoPose.

The standards groups, communities of interest and companies who are exploring implementations, have implemented and/or are supporting the GeoPose standard in other ways will be recognized on the http://www.geopose.org[GeoPose web site].

## Contribute

If you introduce GeoPose to interested parties in written form or during meetings, or if you are implementing GeoPose in your product or service, you are invited to add them/include that information in our outreach documentation by editing the relevant lists.

## Future Plans

We may merge the communities and companies lists into one .adoc for simplicity.

When the GeoPose web site is public and the GeoPose standard is ratified, the communities, companies and web sites where we have promoted the draft specification can be contacted/notified and provided with actions they can take (including but not limited to implementing GeoPose and providing input and feedback to the SWG).
